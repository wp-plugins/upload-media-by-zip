Upload a zip archive and let WP unzip it and attach everything to a page/post

== Description ==

Upload a zip archive and let WP unzip it and attach everything to a page/post.

Works in 2.8 (but please please please update your site if you're using somthing that old)! The tabs in the media pop-up are messed up in 2.8, but since it's 2.8, I won't be fixing it :)

New plugin. Please report bugs to trepmal (at) gmail (dot) com. Thanks!
